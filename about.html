          <h1>Hi — I'm Rhea Trivedi.</h1>
          <p>I am a high school student passionate about understanding one another’s perspectives, social cognition, and the forces that shape society. I believe that examining how we understand ourselves—and our role in social phenomena such as stereotyping—is essential to fostering empathy and addressing pressing social issues.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I have been a podcaster since 2024, creating episodes that blend individual experiences with broader community perspectives through the lens of social cognition. My work explores how we shape society and how society, in turn, shapes us. In recognition of this work, my podcast was acknowledged by NPR, earning a 2025 Student Podcast Challenge Honorable Mention.</p>
